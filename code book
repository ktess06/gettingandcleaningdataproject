# Variables: Imported files named according to sources file names
# activity_labels = six activity codes and corresponding activity names
# features = feature names for X_test, X_train

# subject_test = test set subject number, 1-30
# X_test = test set feature measurements
# y_test = test set activity, coded 1-6

# Subject_train = train set subject number, 1-30
# X_train = train set feature measurements
# y_train = train set activity, coded 1-6

# Variables: Combined data sets
# test = subject_test, y_test, X_test combined, by columns
# train = subject_train, y_train, X_train combined, by columns
# fullSet = test, train, combined by rows

# Variables: Column names
# allNames = set of names corresponding to fullSet, not yet applied
# meanStdColumns = subject, activity, and all features with mean or standard deviation
# reducedSet = fullSet subsetted with meanStdColumns
# reducedNames = allNames subsetted with meanStdColumns, renamed to R conventions; applied to reducedSet

# Variables: Tidy data set
# tidyDataset = data set with average of each variable, by activity, by subject
